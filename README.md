# My Personal Project - Goal Tracker

## Project Proposal

Project Idea: Goal Tracker 

*What will the application do?*

This application will provide a way to add, track, and visualize various goals. 
The user can **add** how many hours they have put into achieving the goal, **track** to see the running 
total hours they have worked on each goal, and **visualize** through a graphical dashboard what progress they have made 
so far. The application will store, modify, save, and load the multiple goals and associated data. Each goal will have a 
set amount of time that represents 100% progress, and the user can continue adding time until they achieve that number. When they are 
finished, the goal will be marked as complete, and the application will say "Congratulations!"

Future functionality includes
- A Pomodoro Timer
- Adding colour + sound to the visualizations
- Incorporating more interactive art in the tracking process bar, ie the growth of a shape as a goal becomes closer and closer to full progress


*Who will use it?*

The target user of this application is a university student who has multiple goals to achieve during their school year,
and must have a consolidated way to store the about each of their goals.

*Why does this project interest me?*

This project interests me as both myself and my peers are the target user and would be extremely helpful in everyday life for managing multiple goals, and being 
able to see at a glance what the progress is on each goal.  

Additionally, I will gain valuable experience designing a Java application through each of the 4 project phases including: basic model and user interaction, data
persistence, graphical user interface, and design.
